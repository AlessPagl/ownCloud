Feature: quota

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files

  @files_sharing-app-required @skipOnEncryption
  Scenario: share receiver with insufficient quota should not be able to copy received shared file to home folder
    Given the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares"
    And auto-accept shares has been disabled
    And user "Brian" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And the quota of user "Brian" has been set to "10 B"
    And the quota of user "Alice" has been set to "10 MB"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "test-content-15" to "/testquota.txt"
    And user "Alice" has shared file "/testquota.txt" with user "Brian"
    And user "Brian" has accepted share "/testquota.txt" offered by user "Alice"
    When user "Brian" copies file "/Shares/testquota.txt" to "/testquota.txt" using the WebDAV API
    # The status indicates that the copy was successful, but actually the copied file does not exist
    # The status is misleading
    Then the HTTP status code should be "201"
    #Then the HTTP status code should be "507"
    #And the DAV exception should be "Sabre\DAV\Exception\InsufficientStorage"
    And as "Brian" file "/testquota.txt" should not exist
